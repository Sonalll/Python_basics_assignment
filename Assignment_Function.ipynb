        "ANS-\n",
        "Using generators offers several advantages over regular functions, particularly when dealing with large datasets or computationally intensive tasks. Here are some key benefits:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. Memory Efficiency\n",
        "Lazy Evaluation: Generators produce items one at a time and only when requested, which means they don't need to store the entire dataset in memory. This is particularly useful for handling large datasets or streams of data.\n",
        "\n",
        "python\n",
        "# Regular function\n",
        "def create_list(n):\n",

        "def create_generator(n):\n",
        "    for i in range(n):\n",
        "        yield i\n",
        "2. Improved Performance\n",
        "Reduced Overhead: Since generators yield items one at a time, they can start producing values immediately without waiting to generate the entire result set. This can lead to faster response times and better performance in scenarios where you don't need all results at once.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. Pipelining of Operations\n",
        "Chaining Generators: Generators can be used in a pipeline, where the output of one generator can be fed into another. This allows for efficient data processing in stages without the need to hold intermediate results in memory.\n",

        "for num in generator_two(5):\n",
        "    print(num)  # Outputs: 0 2 4 6 8\n",
        "State Retention\n",
        "Remembering State: Generators retain their state between executions, allowing them to resume from where they left off. This is useful for implementing iterators and handling complex iteration logic.\n",
        "\n",
        "python\n",

        "\n",
        "Generators are powerful tools that help you write more efficient and readable code, especially when working with large datasets or when you need to process data on-the-fly. They provide a way to iterate over data without the memory overhead of creating a complete list, making them ideal for many real-world applications.\n"
